#### Student project to create the game minesweeper using react components, JSX and react-bootsrap.

### Deployed on Heroku:

## Rules
You are presented with a board of squares. Some squares contain mines (bombs), others don't. If you click on a square containing a bomb, you lose. If you manage to click all the squares (without clicking on any bombs) or flag all the mines, you win.
Clicking a square which doesn't have a bomb reveals the number of neighbouring squares containing bombs. Use this information plus some guess work to avoid the bombs.
To open a square, point at the square and click on it. To mark a square you think is a bomb, point and right-click.
